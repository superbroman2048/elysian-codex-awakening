  const principalMessage = `"The whole purpose of education is to turn mirrors into windows." â€“ Sydney J. Harris

Welcome to Fortune World School! Inspired by the words of Sydney J. Harris, we believe that education should be a window to new vistas and new opportunities for each child. Being the Principal of this school, I am enthusiastic about sharing with you how we strive to make learning a rewarding experience beyond the four walls of the classroom.

At Fortune World School, it is our endeavour to create an environment in which education would be the leading doorway to wider horizons. We are committed to providing a stimulating, invigorating, and supportive learning environment that will help foster inquiry, creativity, critical thinking, and lifelong learning among students. Our objective is to transform "mirrors" of knowledge into "windows" that open up a vista of opportunities.

Our curriculum is intended to inspire and engage on a very high level of critical thinking, creativity, and solution-finding for real-life problems. Our highly esteemed faculty members-merchants of passion and experience in teaching-will ensure that each student travels his or her unique educational journey to be prepared and equipped to enter the future with confidence and curiosity.

We also acknowledge the importance of growth and development through a more holistic approach. We support our academic programs with extracurricular activities, such as sports, arts, community service, and character-building activities, which further develop the many talents of our students. Fortune World School is inclusive and respectful, having welcomed students from different walks of life. We ensure the environment set forth is nurturing, where every child feels valued and well-equipped to work with his peers and build a strong supportive network that contributes toward his success.

Thank you for being a part of the Fortune World School family. We look forward to a year that is full of discovery, growth, and achievement.

Principal
